    <h2 class="blog-tracing">The 81 million dollar heist</h2>

{" "}

<p class="blog-tracing">
  Research and statistics show scary numbers on how much customer data gets
  leaked from companies. We will be surprised when we hear about the largest
  bank heist in history, the Bangladesh Bank breach, when they lost{" "}
  <strong>$81 million!</strong>
</p>
<p class="blog-tracing">
  The scary fact is that they just did not lose money because of the massive
  breach and how it was executed. Their reputation also wallows in the ground,
  and they are no longer trusted, which leads to losing more than $81 million in
  the future. Would you store your money in to a breached bank?
</p>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  Note: The hackers executed the attack using email attachments that exploited
  vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office.

<h2 class="blog-tracing">Teenagers hacking uber </h2>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  Maybe that is not enough. But what about big companies like Uber when teenage
  hackers breached their data?
</p>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  The hacker did his reconnaissance, found a sysadmin’s phone number, and
  flooded the victim with MFA push requests in the middle of the night until the
  targeted Uber employee accepted them.
</p>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  The breach had financial implications for Uber. It not only incurred costs
  related to investigating and addressing the breach but also faced potential
  fines and legal settlements. Moreover, the drop in user engagement and
  tarnished reputation could have affected its business performance and
  valuation.
</p>

<h2 class="blog-tracing">What do these attacks have in common? </h2>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  Now let us take a deep breath and go deep into these incidents. We will
  notice:
</p>
<p class="blog-tracing">In the bank data breach...</p>
<ul class="list-tracing">
  <li class="blog-tracing">
    The network of the bank was not separated (if one network gets hacked, the
    rest will be).
  </li>
  <li class="blog-tracing">
    Hackers can easily break it and redirect millions to their own private
    accounts.
  </li>
  <li class="blog-tracing">
    Microsoft’s security bulletins had already addressed the risks of this
    vulnerability.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="blog-tracing">In the Uber data breach...</p>
<ul class="list-tracing">
  <li class="blog-tracing">
    Lax governance on admin credentials and MFA management
  </li>
  <li class="blog-tracing">
    The original employee was vished—a type of targeted spear phishing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  From vulnerable firewall technology and insecure software in use to social
  engineering, the right penetration testing solution could have discovered
  these risks proactively!
</p>
<center class="blog-tracing">
  <p class="blog-tracing">
    The modern security is effortless, if done correctly.

<h2 class="blog-tracing">What is the solution? </h2>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  Penetration testing can stop preventable breaches from taking down a major
  enterprise!
</p>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  PTaaS has emerged in recent years as a strong offensive security lifeline that
  can measurably reduce risks.
</p>

<p class="blog-tracing">
  PTaaS enables organizations to perform a penetration test daily, or even after
  each code change. You will facilitate more frequent testing across all
  environments.
